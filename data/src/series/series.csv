His father, Seymour â\x80\x93 distant and cold, obsessed with building the Durst Organization into a real-estate behemoth and leaving his mark on the Manhattan skyline â\x80\x93 pressures young Robert to join the family business. Durst describes his disinterest in following in his father's footsteps, and recalls meeting Kathie McCormack, a beautiful girl from a modest background. The couple fall in love and move to Vermont, where they lead a simple life and run a health-food store called All Good Things. But not long after, Seymour prevails and Robert returns to New York to take his place at the powerful Durst Organization. 1982: Robert and Kathie have been married for nearly 10 years, during which they have moved from their idyllic life in Vermont back to New York City. They divide their time between a penthouse apartment on Riverside Drive, and an upstate house on picturesque Lake Truesdale, 50 miles north of Manhattan. After a weekend at the lake house, Durst walks into the 20th Precinct and tells desk sergeant Michael Struk that he hasn't seen his wife in five days. He says that when he last saw her, he was putting her on a train in Katonah to return to NYC for medical school classes. The details of their last weekend together are a subject of much controversy by those who know the couple.

To balance things out, the artist takes her to McDonald's, where the pair become the most elegantly dressed duo in the establishment's history. <br /><br />Steve and Miranda decide to finally tie the knot, but vow not to have an elaborate wedding. Keeping things low-key isn't as easy as it sounds, but they eventually manage to work things out, finding a perfect community garden in which to hold their ceremony. <br /><br />Not to be left behind in the romance department, Harry takes Charlotte to an upscale French restauarant. The meal is wonderful, but later that night, the newlyweds both come down with acute food poisoning. The romantic evening breaks down, as the pair alternates dashes to the restroom. The experience may not be the most intimate, but it does make clear their genuine love and caring for each other. <br /><br />After seeing herself pictured in In Touch magazine, Samantha decides to get breast augmentation. However, during her initial consultation with a plastic surgeon, a lump is found in her breast. The biopsy reveals that the growth is cancerous, and Samantha realizes that she's in for the fight of her life. <br /><br />The day of Steve and Miranda's wedding arrives, but before they get to the ceremony, Samantha discloses her condition to Carrie. Samantha is very matter-of-fact, and swears Carrie to temporary secrecy, as not to ruin Miranda's big day.

He also mentions that he doesn't want to have any more children, making Carrie wonder if she'll be willing to give up a man for a baby that she may or may not want to have. <br /><br />Samantha's cancer treatments hit a rough spot when her male physician offends her by mentioning that some studies show that childless women have an increased risk for breast cancer. Samantha vows to receive treatment from a female doctor. Unfortunately, the top female specialist, Dr. McAndrew, has a months-long waiting list. Samantha tries namedropping her way into the doctor's schedule, but to no avail. Luckily, McAndrew's receptionist idolizes Smith, so a quick mention of his name manages to get Samantha (and a fellow patient) onto the toughest list in Manhattan. <br /><br />Miranda and Steve take their honeymoon, but Miranda finds it somewhat difficult to totally relax in the wilderness setting chosen by her husband. The lack of television, radio and other distractions (along with Steve's raging libido) drives Miranda crazy. <br /><br />While Miranda and Steve are on their honeymoon, baby Brady is entrusted to both Carrie and Charlotte. Carrie enjoys her time with Brady (taking him fingerpainting at Petrovsky's), but Charlotte winds up stressing out. She flips when Brady accidentally winds up seeing a lovemaking session between her and Harry, convincing her that she's scarred the child for life. Miranda eventually assuages Charlotte's fears... somewhat. <br /><br />Carrie confronts Petrovsky about potentially wanting a child some day. She says that she thinks that she could ultimately end up with him, but that she worries that this issue will eventually tear them apart.

Carrie doesn't appreciate Petrovsky's black and white viewpoint, and she walks out on him. <br /><br />Samantha's cancer treatments are going well, and she reacts positively to the chemo. Unfortunately, the procedure causes her hair to begin falling out. Samantha freaks out at this development, especially since she has Smith's big premiere coming up. A trip to a wig store proves unsuccessful, since none of the pieces can match her fabulous hair. After all of this, Samantha is forced to admit to both Carrie and herself that her condition scares her greatly. She then takes matters into her own hands, and decides to shave her head. Proving that chivalry isn't dead, Smith also shaves his own head in a show of solidarity, and the pair make the premiere in style. <br /><br />Charlotte and Harry's quest to conceive continues in vain as Charlotte's latest round of IVF proves unsuccessful. She tries to run away from her problems (literally) by taking frequent jogs in the park. During one of these runs, Charlotte meets Trudy Stork and her King Charles spaniel Princess Dandyridge Brandywine. The Princess is a showdog, but she doesn't compete due to a minor cosmetic flaw. Charlotte relates to the dog, and her perceived imperfections. Trudy sees the bond between the two, and gives Dandyridge to Mrs. York Goldenblatt. A quick namechange to Elizabeth Taylor Goldenblatt cements the dog's place as the newest member of Charlotte's family. <br /><br />Steve and Miranda discover that their apartment just isn't big enough for the two of them, Brady, Fatty and Scout. Steve suggests that the family move to Brooklyn, but the thought of leaving Manhattan doesn't sit well with Miranda. She grudgingly decides to take a look at one house in the outer borough, and though she doesn't immediately fall in love with the place, she does realize that moving to Brooklyn is the best course of action for her family. After some quick negotiations, she signs the deal, and the house is theirs. <br /><br />After another mouse invades Carrie's apartment, she calls Petrovsky to try and eliminate that problem.

During this period, Carrie starts to wonder if she and Petrovsky have anything in common. They never talk about work, even though Petrovsky has a huge exhibition looming in Paris. When Carrie finally does come home from Petrovsky\'s, she\'s got a week\'s worth of messages waiting for her... all from Big. She erases the messages, and gets a sense of satisfaction from doing so. <br /><br />Samantha (along with her fabulous collection of wigs) is non-plussed to hear growing rumors that Smith is actually gay. However, after a carefully cropped image of Smith, Stanford and Marcus sees print, the talk intensifies, and Sam is stuck with the label of ""fag hag."" To combat the rumors, Sam breaks out a video camera, and films a raunchy sex scene between her and Smith. The tape ""leaks"" to the press, and Smith\'s (and Sam\'s) sexual preferences are firmly established once and for all. <br /><br />Charlotte decides to take Elizabeth Taylor back into competition, entering the King Charles Spaniel in a dog show. The event doesn\'t go smoothly, as Elizabeth goes into heat right before the judging. Despite leaving a trail of blood droplets in the ring, Elizabeth takes first prize, largely due to the judge being sweet on Charlotte. Harry and Charlotte take Elizabeth to the park to celebrate, but the spaniel ends up mounted by numerous other pooches, much to the dismay of the Goldenblatts. <br /><br />The general disarray of the Hobbes/Brady house in Brooklyn is starting to get to Miranda.

Enid asks Carrie to set her up with one of Petrovsky\'s friends, but when she produces food critic Martin Grable at the party, Enid\'s reaction is tepid. Instead, Enid tries to put the moves on Petrovsky, a tack that is quickly headed off by Carrie. <br /><br />Also at the party is former ""it girl"" Lexi Featherston, an old running partner of Carrie. Unfortunately, Lexi is a 25-year-old party girl in a 40-year-old body, and she quickly wears out her welcome at the event.
