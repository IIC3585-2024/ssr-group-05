Disaster strikes for 25-year-old Monique, who injures herself at the checkpoint, causing a three-hour delay. Her father, Ladi, makes a vital decision that could catapult them back into the race, but there is a catch. The threat of elimination brings out the competitive sides of married couple Zainib and Mobeen, who have differing ideas about who is boss. Marc realises he has to face up to his fears if he and brother Michael are to claw back some time and avoid elimination.
